## How to Play?

The rules are simple! One player starts off by clicking on, “**truth** or **dare**" button. If the player clicks “**truth**”, a question will appear on the screen that he/she must answer honestly. If he/she chooses “**dare**”, he/she will be given a command or some kind of action/task he/she need to perform.

Regardless of the choice, it’s a fun game for everyone, and the room is sure to be filled with roaring laughter! To keep the game fun, make sure your truth questions deal with a sore topic that could embarrass them, and make sure the dares don't send anyone to the emergency room or jail!
